# Art151Project1
This is my Art151 project 1
In this project, the description is that is  is a circular pattern where it changes into a singular color if you click and if you mobe the cursor the wavelength of the pattern increrases and shape of the pattern also increases. Also, ifyou clock on the mouse  or the trackpad then the shape  of the patter changes. If you press on the left and the right arrow the wavelength slows down and if you click on the left arrow then the wavelength moves into the opposite direction but comes back to the same wavelenght.
